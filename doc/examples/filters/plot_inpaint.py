Inpainting
===========
Inpainting [1]_ is the process of reconstructing lost or deteriorated
parts of images and videos. 

The reconstruction is supposed to be performed in fully automatic way by
exploiting the information presented in non-damaged regions.

In this example, we show how the masked pixels get inpainted by
inpainting algorithm based on 'biharmonic equation'-assumption [2]_ [3]_.
